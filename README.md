# Slotted-Vivaldi-Antenna
Objectives:
@ Develop and optimize a Vivaldi antennas to achieve a broader bandwidth.
@ Enhance the gain of Slotted Vivaldi antennas for improved signal strength and directionality
Result and Conclusion:
@ The designed antenna exhibits a significantly broader bandwidth across all stages compared to previous models. Stage 4 achieved a bandwidth of 12 GHz, exceeding the initial limitations reported in the literature.
@ The project achieved a steady increase in maximum gain across all stages. The final stage boasts a maximum gain of 7.52 dB, a substantial improvement over previous low-gain limitations.
